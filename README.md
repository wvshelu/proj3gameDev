# proj3gameDev: H202

## Game Description
Mystery game in which the player must solve puzzles to escape.

## Development
Worked in a team of 5 to develop the game complete with personalized artwork and music/sound effects via Unity, a cross-platform game development engine, and its teamwork feature Unity Collaborate.

## Personal contributions by Sherry
* Implemented monster AI to move toward player and navigate through obstacles by identifying closest target point associated with the obstacle; interaction between monsters is to treat other monsters as obstacles and navigating around them with priority based on id
* Implemented the key code puzzle, monster trapping mechanics, and end game scene
* Implemented user interaction, specifically movement, interaction through doors, and interaction with puzzles
* Implemented save feature, so that users, if they download the game onto own machine, would be able to generate a file that can be reloaded to preserve all states (including monster position, solved puzzles, inventory items, etc.)
* Fixed puzzles such as key fixing, wire connecting, and teddy bear scene
* Fixed inventory addition and usage; also implemented inventory state saving across different scenes
* Added in artwork and music developed by the artist and musician in our team
